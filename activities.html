                        <p>Have you ever been without warm clothes to protect you against the cold? Have you ever been without hot lunch every day? How did you feel? It seems that nothing makes a man more humble and
                          unsure of himself as poverty, which wrecks personal happiness and international relationships. </p>
                        <p>I did not feel keenly about it prior to my experience of volunteer teaching in Qianxinan Buyei and Miao Autonomous Prefecture of Guizhou Province. Under harsh living conditions, soon I had a
                          fever. However, looking into the pure and trusting eyes of those kids, I felt a great sense of responsibility and persisted in preparing lessons and teaching.
                          At evenings, we played games with them. Though they lacked of sufficient materials to keep warm and full, and had to climb rugged mountains to arrive at school, their strong thirst for knowledge
                          made me want to keep moving forward on social work and sociology. Driven by the belief, our group spared no effort to collect all accessible clothes and school supplies for them.
